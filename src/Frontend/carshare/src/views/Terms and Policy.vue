<p>Your rental starts and finishes according to the pick-up and drop-off dates and times detailed on your voucher / eVoucher. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide refunds for unused time if a car is picked up late or dropped off early.

<h3>Personal data you give us</h3>

<p>We store and use the information that you give us. When you make a booking, we need at least your name, email address and payment information. We might also ask for your home address, phone number and date of birth, and the names of any additional drivers.<p>

<p>If you get in touch with us (by phone, by email or through social media, for example) we will collect information from you there too.<p>

<p>After your booking, we may ask you to provide a review to help us improve our services, and to help ensure future customers get exactly what they’re looking for.<p>

<p>There are also other ways you might give us information. For example, if you’re browsing with your mobile device, you can share your current location with us, so we can provide you with the best possible service.

It also makes it easier to make future bookings.<p>

<h3>Personal data you give us about others</h3>

<p>You might add someone as an additional driver, or you might make a booking on behalf of someone else, for example, a friend, family member or colleague. If you do, please make sure that that person knows you’re giving us their details, and has accepted the way we handle their personal data (as described in this Notice). This is your responsibility.<p>

<h3>Personal data we collect automatically</h3>

<p>When you make a booking, we record what platform you made it on, and how you got to our platform (if you came through from another site, for example).<p>

<h3>Confirming your booking and taking payment</h3>

<p>In most cases, we will confirm your booking immediately using the email address provided when the booking is made. Sometimes, we need to wait for the car hire company to confirm that a car is available. We will tell you straight away if this happens, and temporarily block the money on your payment card. As soon as they confirm your car, we will let you know, and take the money from your card.<p>

<p>Until your car is confirmed, you can ‘void’ the payment at any time. Just hit ‘Manage booking’ at the top of our site, enter the email address provided when making the booking and reservation number, then hit ‘Cancel Booking’. We will unblock the money on your card.<p>

<p>Very rarely, a car hire company can’t confirm that a car is available. If this happens, we will tell you, and unblock the money on your card.<p>

<p>When you book a car or other product on our site, we will email you to confirm its availability within 48 hours of booking (or, if earlier, at least 24 hours before your pick-up time). We will then send you a booking confirmation.<p>

<p>You will not have a contract until we have confirmed your booking and taken the payment. We will send all correspondence to the address provided when making the booking. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these terms shall entitle any third party to any benefit or rights pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.<p>
